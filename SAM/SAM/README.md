# Work environment regulations

The "Swedish Work Environment Authority" (arbetsmiljöverket, av.se) maintains a large collection of "provisions" (föreskrifter, AFSar) and many of the are available in both English and Swedish. The core of this is the "SAM" AFS (2001:1) which describes how "Systematic Work Environment Management" (Systematiskt arbetsmiljöarbete, SAM) should be carried out.

This directory contains (inofficial) copies of the core of the SAM AFS in pure text format (with light org-mode markup) in both Swedish and English for easy comparison. The intention is to also build up a translation table of concepts and terminology in the SAM area.

## Notes and interpretations

* ["Skyddsrond"](http://www.arbetsmiljoupplysningen.se/Amnen/Skyddsrond/) ("safety inspection" or "work environment check") is not explicitly mentioned in the text, but fits under the first part of 8§ about "regularly investigate working conditions".
